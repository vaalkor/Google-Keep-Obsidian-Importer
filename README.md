A very simple python script for converting [google keep](https://www.google.com/keep/) data exported with [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) friendly markdown files.

If you want something that will use the Keep API to import stuff, there's [Keep it Markdown](https://github.com/djsudduth/keep-it-markdown).
